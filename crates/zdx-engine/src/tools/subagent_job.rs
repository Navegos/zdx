//! Managed subagents: `invoke_subagent` calls that can run in the background.
//!
//! Two kinds of call use this module. `background: true` starts the child and
//! returns a handle at once. A normal call in a run with a handoff bound waits
//! like a blocking call, and hands the same child off to the background if it
//! is still running at the bound, the way `Bash` relocates a slow command. In
//! both, the child is an ordinary `zdx exec` run, started through the same
//! spawn path as a blocking one and held from the start by the shared
//! adopted-jobs registry ([`zdx_tools::adopted`]). Only when it is handed off
//! is it registered in the background-process registry
//! ([`crate::background_activity`]) under its `bg_id`, which makes it a job
//! like any other: `background_output` reads it and `background_kill` stops
//! it, through the same lease that stops a command. A child that finishes
//! before the handoff returns its answer and leaves no job behind.
//!
//! "Background" means the call does not block the turn, not that the child
//! outlives it. Every managed child is registered with the agent turn that
//! started it ([`TurnTasks`]) from the moment it starts, and that turn stops
//! whatever is still running when it ends, however it ends. The caller does
//! not have to collect or kill anything for the child to be cleaned up.
//!
//! The child's stdout carries its JSONL agent events. A reader task condenses
//! them into the job's stdout log as one compact record per line, from the
//! start, so progress made before a handoff is kept; until the handoff it also
//! relays them live to the caller. `background_output` derives progress and
//! the result from that log.
