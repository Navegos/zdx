//! Pixel-dimension clamping for provider-bound images.

//! Vision APIs cap how large an image may be in pixels, independently of its
//! byte size. A screenshot of a long page compresses to well under any byte
//! budget while still being tens of thousands of pixels tall, so byte-size
//! checks alone let invalid images through.
//!
//! Anthropic rejects an oversized `tool_result` image with a validation error
//! instead of downscaling it server-side, which fails the whole turn. Clamping
//! here, at every point where bytes become base64 bound for a provider, is what
